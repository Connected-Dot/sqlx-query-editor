# SQLx Query Generator

The SQLx Query Generator is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you generate SQL queries using the SQLx library in Rust. It provides a set of powerful features to streamline your database interactions and make your code more maintainable.

## Features

### 1. Query Generation

The extension allows you to generate SQL queries easily and efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface to create queries for various database operations, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. You can specify the table, columns, conditions, and other parameters to generate the desired query.

### 2. SQLx Integration

The SQLx Query Generator seamlessly integrates with the SQLx library, which is a popular Rust library for database access. It leverages the power of SQLx to execute the generated queries and interact with the database. This ensures that your queries are efficient, secure, and compatible with a wide range of database systems.

### 3. Code Generation

In addition to query generation, the extension also supports code generation. It can automatically generate Rust code snippets that use the SQLx library to execute the generated queries. This saves you time and effort by eliminating the need to manually write the code for executing queries.

### 4. Query Validation

The SQLx Query Generator includes a query validation feature that helps you catch errors and typos in your queries. It performs syntax checking and provides helpful error messages if there are any issues with the generated queries. This ensures that your queries are valid and can be executed without any runtime errors.

### 5. Customization

The extension offers various customization options to suit your preferences and project requirements. You can configure the formatting style of the generated queries, choose the database dialect, and specify other settings to align with your project's database setup.
